2. (d) Population structure of six goat breeds inferred by ADMIXTURE results from K = 2–3 are shown.
3. Clustering with ADMIXTURE as well as clustering using PLINK haplotypes was nearly equivalent and only two animals clustered differently across methods
4. The R script suggested by the ADMIXTURE procedure was used to perform a graphical representation of the ADMIXTURE results
5. With British and Scandinavian references, we find agreement across both ADMIXTURE and the haplotype-based methods, which employ subtly different marker information—either allele frequencies or haplotypes

2. For each sample, Mascot search result *.dat files for nodes with/without extract were processed in Scaffold (http://www.proteomesoftware.com) combined as MUDPIT experiment to validate protein and peptide identifications.
3. The detected protein sequence was also examined in Mascot software to derive 50% conformity with anthrax PA (Figure 4)
4. Regarding the Vip2Ac-like_3 protein, it was detected just in one replicate with Mascot (Table 4 and Table S3) and the Sip1Aa-like_2 protein was detected in two replicates, but in one of them only with Mascot (Table 4, Tables S1 and S3) and, therefore, the Vip2Ac-like_3 and Sip1Aa-like_2 proteins were not considered a positive identification.
5. In almost every case the Mascot score was relatively high, whereby even the ‘unique dinosaur peptide’ GLPGESGAVGPAGPPGSR was identified with all scores 70 or above (although not directly comparable, higher than the originally reported Mascot score of 54.3), despite this not being reported in the ostrich bone collagen analyses by Asara et al

2. Scan statistics analysis, a retrospective statistical test based on a discrete Poisson model performed by SaTScan (Martin Kulldorff, Boston, MA, USA), is used to detect whether the IR of TB shows clustering characteristics and to determine the location and relative risk (RR) of the clusters
3. The Global Moran’s I and spatial scan statistical tests were done to explore the presence of clustering in the study area and local spatial clusters (hotspots) of unimproved sources of drinking water using ArcGIS version 10.3 [17] and Kuldorff’s SaTScan version 9.4 [18] softwares, respectively
4. Figure 2 displays only those counties contained in clusters reported by SaTScan when the maximum-size parameter is set to 40%
5. SaTScan on the other hand has the ability to control for these individual-level risk factors (i.e., since we know that African American women are at increased risk of having a low birthweight infant SaTScan can remove the effect of race to detect clusters of women/infants in areas that are unknown)

2. Diversity patterns were then tested for statistical differences across sites in the vegan R package with the PERMANOVA function “adonis” and tested for homogeneity of variances with the function “betadisper.” OTUs that showed high and significant correlation with sample groups were identified through the function “multipatt” in the indicspecies package (De Cáceres & Legendre, 2009).
3. The significance of the grouping factors used as constraints in the CCA was assessed via the permutation test (Oksanen et al., 2013) in the vegan R package
4. We used three statistical methods to determine the relative importance of climate and landscape variables on genetic divergence: (a) partial Mantel test using the vegan R package; (b) GDM (Ferrier et al., 2007) using the gdm R package (Fitzpatrick et al., 2020); and (c) dbRDA (McArdle & Anderson, 2001) using the vegan R package.
5. In addition, to quantify the fraction of the behavioural variance that could be inferred from the above-mentioned 12 factors, a constrained analysis was performed using an automatic stepwise model built with permutation tests (ordistep function, vegan R library)

Search spaces for AutoDockFR are shown in brackets and include surrounding the peptide binding groove (PBG), surrounding around the known ligand binding position (Ligand) and surrounding the top three largest binding pockets to increase the search space to enable binding away from the peptide binding groove (Top 3)
3. AutoDockFR differs from the other programs as it takes into account receptor flexibility by allowing the user to specify flexible residues within the target structure, this allows the program to simulate induced fit caused by ligand binding where changes occur mainly in the residues side chains
4. The demonstrated ability of AutoDockFR in identifying correct solutions for problems with up to 14 flexible receptor side-chains lessens this requirement.

Concerning this aspect, it is important to mention the recent publication of guidelines for the rigorous and transparent adoption of AI in the clinical practice: CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials–Artificial Intelligence) [33] and SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials–Artificial Intelligence) [34].
2. Results: SPIRIT-AI and CONSORT-AI include recommendations which are AI-specific, such as asking authors to provide clear descriptions of the AI system, including instructions and skills required for use, the operational environment in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of input and output data of the AI system, the human–AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases.
3. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions
4. The group noted that, while of interest, this field is relatively early in its development without tangible examples in healthcare applications, and that it would not be appropriate for it to be included in CONSORT-AI at this stage.60 This topic will be monitored and revisited in future iterations of CONSORT-AI
5. There is also recognition that AI is a rapidly evolving field and there will be the need to update CONSORT-AI as the technology and newer applications for it develop

Ensembl,EnsEmbl,"1. Additional data in the comparison of metazoan genomes has been obtained from the EnsEmbl web server, containing the version 43 (February 2007) of the EnsEmbl annotation [48] for most of the species, the currently discontinued version 38 (April 2006) of the EnsEmbl annotation for A
2. dN/dS values for human genes relative to mouse orthologs were acquired from EnsEmbl via BioMart
3. The composition of these events varies (Table S1): the 1,070 AS events detected in RefSeq correspond to 85 structural distinct classes (A), whereas the 4,321 events in EnsEmbl show 388 classes (C)
4. ""Further, the sequence is usually included in the EnsEmbl gene tree together with another sequence from the same species carrying the canonical name such as """"Sox2"""".""
5. Each gene in each significant set is represented by its EnsEmbl ID.

3. Test results were extracted from GeneXpert software; unsuccessful tests were analysed in relation to testing sites and trends over time
4. One shortcoming of the Revogene instrument during our testing was that we were not notified of any error when loading the pie onto the instrument until the run was complete; this caused error/invalid rates of 2.4% for the Revogene, while the GeneXpert had a 0% error/invalid rate
5. In comparison, GeneXpert testing can provide accurate detection of TB and rifampicin resistance, with sensitivities compared to culture of 90% and 96% respectively, in under 90 minutes [2]

2. Until now, therefore, it has been difficult to demonstrate whether Pulsox screening is likely to be equally effective at identifying all types of CCHD.
3. For consistency with previous work, we have adopted the definition of CCHD from a recently published meta-analysis of Pulsox screening [23], including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), pulmonary atresia (PA)––with duct-dependent pulmonary flow including those with or without intact ventricular septum and MAPCA’s, critical/severe pulmonary valve stenosis (PS), critical aortic stenosis (AS), interruption of the aortic arch (IAA), coarctation of the aorta (CoA), tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), transposition o
4. • In general, Pulsox yield of abnormal results is low for CCHD diagnoses not associated with critically reduced pulmonary blood flow; however, increasing the Pulsox threshold increased the proportion of infants with an abnormal result
5. Although there are many previously published studies on Pulsox screening, they have all included relatively low numbers of infants with CCHD [23]

3. The proposed method TM-MCluster consists of three major steps: 1) representing each read as a vector of k-mers with occurring frequencies; 2) transforming each read vector to a topic distribution vector based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [15]; 3) clustering the vectorized reads by the SKWIC algorithm [16], as in the MCluster method [14]
4. Out of the 12 tested datasets, our method achieves the best F1, precision and sensitivity on 10, 6 and 5 datasets, respectively; and MCluster ranks first in F1 and sensitivity on 3 datasets, while MetaCluster 3.0 outperforms the others in precision and sensitivity on 7 and 5 datasets respectively, but it does not perform best in F1 on any dataset
5.

Primer3,PRIME20,"1. PRIME20 is an extension of PRIME (Protein Intermediate-Resolution Model) and is designed to be applicable to all twenty amino acid residues.[38,51–53] The adequacy and efficiency of PRIME20 has been proven by applying to short peptide systems such as Aβ16–22, fragments of the prion proteins, the designed sequences of Lopez de la Paz et al, and the tau fragment (VQIVYK).[39,40,54,55] Aβ17–42 is modeled using the PRIME20 4-sphere-per-residue representation (backbone united atoms NH, CαH, and CO, and a single 
2. The powerful combination of a four-sphere-per-residue protein model, PRIME20, and discontinuous molecular dynamics significantly facilitated the tracking of the aggregation process of peptide chains (Aβ17–42) that are longer than the 6 to 10 amino-acid peptides that have been considered usually in the past
3. This broad ensemble of structures may be a consequence of having a highly rugged energy landscape, which causes a variety of amorphous aggregates or polymorphic fibril conformations even in experiments, or it may partly depend on our having a coarse-grained force field like PRIME20 where the side-chain sizes and interactions are imprecise and not optimized for zipping up via van der Waals interactions between atoms
4. In step 2, DMD/PRIME20 simulations test whether the pairs coassemble but do not self-assemble in a reasonable time frame, 5 μs
5. Although PRIME20 parameters generate excellent fibrillization processes and final fibril structures2857, we observed a slightly higher propensity to form β-sheets even in the early stages of simulation

Primer3,Primmer,"1. We used the human genome as a reference as it is the best annotated mammalian genome and GO terms should be mostly species neutral (see Primmer )
2. At the same time, the choice of an appropriate background reference list is important (Primmer ), and in this case we contend that the full set of mammalian genes is appropriate, even though the outliers and fixed difference SNPs were chosen from among the loci identified from a subsample of sites provided by the RAD data
3. In addition, microsatellites are generally found in non-coding regions, where the substitution rate is higher than in the coding regions, and hence, the flanking regions of the microsatellites, where the primers are designed, are prone to mutations (Primmer )

2. The taxon-specific training sets for identification of Zur-binding motifs were composed of the previously identified Zur-binding sites in Firmicutes, α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria [62] and the DNA motif search profiles were constructed using the SignalX program

3. To further distinguish the iron utilization profiles in Mtb between siderophore and heme, we used a permutation test on insertion counts (resampling analysis in Transit [45]) and found that 64 and 54 genes are involved in utilization of MBT and heme, respectively, by comparing the number of transposon insertions in each gene in medium with high mycobactin concentrations (250 ng/mL) versus hemin (Fig 3D, S7 Table)

Tracer,TraCeR,"1. developed the TraCeR method, which was able to reconstruct full-length, paired T cell receptor sequences from V(D)J regions to link single T lymphocyte specificity with functional responses as well as the transcriptional landscape [28].
2. Additionally, the output of TraCeR (Stubbington et al., 2016) was used to remove cells without a detected TCR sequence, as well as invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells and γ∂ T cells (defined as cells with at least one γ and one ∂ chain detected and no αβ pair)
3. With the advent of single-cell sequencing data, tools such as TraCeR are now able to identify paired alpha–beta sequences within individual cells that have the same receptor sequences and thus have been derived from the same clonally expanded cells [145].
4. Expression analysis was carried out with DESeq2 and TCR sequences were retrieved from the antigen-specific T cell RNAseq datasets utilizing the TraCeR software package
5. By using TraCeR, we reconstructed four unique TCR sequences that used this TR_V gene segment, and then profiled the expression of each of the four TCR sequences

2. In all configurations, Trace-OC outperforms both TomoPy and Trace
3. This finding was highly evident in effect size maps for Trace and on subsequent analysis by histogram comparisons, which indicated a global reduction in diffusivity that was most pronounced for brains observed 4–16 weeks after CCI
4. Compared with Trace, the speedups with Trace-OC are from 1.12 to 1.21, which result in up to 18% reduction in reconstruction time.

FastQC,FASTQZ,"1.  Sequence compression techniques fall into two categories: reference-based methods, such as QUIP, CRAM, PATHENC and FASTQZ, exploit similarities between reads and a reference genome [2–5], whereas de novo compression schemes in FQZCOMP, SCALCE, FASTQZ, DSRC, ORCOM, BEETL, MINCE exploit similarities between reads themselves [5–10]
2. On the other hand, FQZCOMP and especially FASTQZ exhibit strange behavior, as parameters that should yield smaller compressed files and lower F-scores sometimes achieve bigger compressed sizes and lower F-scores.
3. Our approach also yields better compression ratios than context model based methods such as FASTQZ or FQZCOMP, which, in a way, also learn the underlying genome from the context
